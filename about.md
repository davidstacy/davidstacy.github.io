From time to time I will post some real world results about how to get things done in the DevOps world.

I am the DevOps lead at [Roadtrippers](https://roadtrippers.com) where I am constantly learning the wrongs and rights of building reliable sites with fast feature updates.

If I learn anything good I will post it here.
