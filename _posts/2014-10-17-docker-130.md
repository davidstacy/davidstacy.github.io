[Docker 1.3 is released](http://blog.docker.com/2014/10/docker-1-3-signed-images-process-injection-security-options-mac-shared-directories/).

I am cautiously pessimistic about this, the project is definitely moving in the right direction and solving the real problems we are encountering in the field.  This is fantastic.

- The native sharing for boot2docker on OSX is a huge major sticking point for many of our devs, and hopefully this will solve that.

- Docker exec is a fantastic idea and even with ns-enter workaround, this is better.  I can have a running long term container and now I can sneak in and modify something about that container or take a look around without stopping or suspending the running process.  Nice.

Looking forward to working with this new release.  I've already updated my Vagrant file and am re-provisioning at this moment.
